===== Q4 =====

=== Answer ===
A user request from frontend to database follows this path: 1. The frontend, built with React and served through a CDN, sends the request to the backend services. 2. The backend services, written primarily in Python and Go, process the request. 3. The data is then retrieved from the PostgreSQL clusters, which store primary transactional data. 4. Redis is used for caching and session storage, but it's not clear if this step is involved in every user request. 5. Long-term analytics data is stored in a Snowflake data warehouse, but again, it's not clear if this step is involved in every user request.
